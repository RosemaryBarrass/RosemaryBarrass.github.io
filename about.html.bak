  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Rosemary. 
  I will be starting my graduate studies this fall in Operations Research.
  I completed dual degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics at Washington State University Vancouver.
  During my undergraduate studies, I completed an REU on AC OPF(AC Optimal Power Flow) relaxations which spurred my interest in energy optimization.
  My goal for this blog is to share some of the basic concepts of AC OPF for those who may be interested in power systems and operations research.
  Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking, knitting, sewing, and swing dancing.
  I love vintage fashion and music, particularly that of the 1940s.
  I also have two cats: Cypher and Bean.</p>

## About This Project <a name="about"></a>
As a researcher, I am constantly learning. 
I have created this blog as a place where I can (somewhat informally) share some of the knowledge that I have gained from my research.
The goal of this blog is to be a resource for undergraduate students who may be new to optimization and want to know more about the specialized field of optimal power flow.
This blog is meant to be a starting point that can provide students, and other curious folks, a broad understanding of optimal power flow (OPF) concepts.
